# Real-Estate-Valuation-Analysis
Real Estate Valuation Analysis in New Taipei City

Overview

The project involved a comprehensive analysis of a subset of real-estate valuation data, sourced from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. This dataset contained key details of properties in New Taipei City, Taiwan, focusing on the age of houses, their distance to the nearest Mass Rapid Transit (MRT) station, the number of nearby convenience stores, and their unit prices. The unit price was measured in 10,000 New Taiwan Dollars per Ping (1 Ping = 3.3 square meters).

Objectives & Methods

The project encompassed several aspects of data analysis:

Simple Linear Regression Analysis: The dataset was loaded in R, where a simple linear regression was conducted to explore the relationship between the number of convenience stores (convenience_stores) and the unit price (unit_price) of houses.
Model Summary and Interpretation: The summary of the regression model was printed in R, with a focus on interpreting the coefficient estimate for convenience_stores.
Statistical Significance Assessment: This phase assessed the statistical significance of the association between the number of convenience stores and the unit price.
Confidence Interval Calculation: A 99% confidence interval was calculated for the coefficient associated with convenience_stores.
Coefficient of Determination Interpretation: The project included an interpretation of the coefficient of determination (RÂ²) for the model, providing a layman's explanation of its significance.

Data Visualization: A scatterplot was created, showcasing the relationship between unit_price and convenience_stores, along with the regression line from the model.
Deliverables

The project resulted in a detailed report that encapsulated the findings from each area of analysis. This report not only highlighted the statistical relationships within the data but also provided visual insights into how the presence of convenience stores impacts real estate prices in New Taipei City. The analysis successfully blended statistical rigor with practical insights, offering a nuanced understanding of the real estate market in the region.
